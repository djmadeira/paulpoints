# WTF
This is a tiny twitter bot for tracking "PaulPoints". Yea.

# TODO
* Better input validation
* Security hardening
* Making terrible code less terrible
* Making commands less brittle. For example, it would be nice if the bot could parse more casual syntax, such as "@example haha nice @paul_points award 50"
